Linux之父Linus Torvalds的十大名言，您听说过几句？

1. “Software is like sex: it’s better when it’s free.”  
软件就像性，免费的比花钱的好得多.

2. “Microsoft isn’t evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.”  
微软并不是魔鬼,只是它的操作系统实在太蹩脚了

3. “My name is Linus, and I am your God.”  
我是Linus，我是神. Hia Hia Hia

4. “See, you not only have to be a good coder to create a system like Linux, you have to be a sneaky bastard too.”  
要想能够创造Linux这样得操作系统不只是需要良好得程序员，还得需要一批心理阴暗的混蛋

5. “The Linux philosophy is ‘Laugh in the face of danger’. Oops. Wrong One. ‘Do it yourself’. Yes, that’s it.”  
Linux的哲学就是“在危险面前放声大笑”，呵呵，不是这句，应该是“一切靠自己，自力更生”才对。

6. “Some people have told me they don’t think a fat penguin really embodies the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry penguin charging at them in excess of 100 mph.”  
很多朋友和我说那只耪企鹅不配代表Linux操作系统，因为他们从来没见过一只愤怒的企鹅以100迈的速度向他们发起攻击

7. “Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.”  
天赋就是事半功倍

8. “When you say, ‘I wrote a program that crashed Windows,’ people just stare at you blankly and say, ‘Hey, I got those with the system, for free.’”  
你骄傲的和别人说，嘿，我写了个能让Windows崩溃的程序，他们会说“哥们，我装Windows系统的时候就免费带着了”

9. “I don’t doubt at all that virtualization is useful in some areas. What I doubt rather strongly is that it will ever have the kind of impact that the people involved in virtualization want it to have.”  
我对虚拟化的技术使用没有任何怀疑，我怀疑的是他们对人的影响。

10. “Now, most of you are probably going to be totally bored out of your minds on Christmas day, and here’s the perfect distraction. Test 2.6.15-rc7. All the stores will be closed, and there’s really nothing better to do in between meals.”  
大家在圣诞期间可能会非常无聊，现在有好办法了，试试内核2.6.15-rc7版吧，茶余饭后的好消遣哦
